Hey team!
Since we are going to work with branches, 
remember to create one always
with the command "git checkout -b nameOfTheBranch"

Make sure to use it to commit the changes

After commiting, delete it using "git branch -d branchUsed"

Create another branch and repeat the process

If you want to update the files, use: "git pull origin main"
and "git fetch origin" if you want to check the changes first
